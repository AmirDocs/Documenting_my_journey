## Why These Topics Matter for DevOps Engineers 💡  
DevOps engineers are responsible for bridging the gap between development and operations, ensuring smooth software delivery pipelines, and maintaining robust infrastructure. To excel in this role, mastering these core areas is essential:  
- **Linux**: Forms the foundation of most server environments.  
- **Bash**: Enables automation of repetitive tasks.  
- **Networking**: Vital for understanding cloud and containerised environments.  
- **Git**: Powers collaboration and version control.  
- **Docker**: Simplifies application deployment through containerisation.  
- **AWS**: Provides scalable cloud infrastructure.  
- **Terraform**: Automates infrastructure provisioning.  
- **CI/CD**: Ensures efficient software delivery pipelines.  
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates containers for scalability and reliability.  

Each topic folder includes practical examples, mini-challenges, and a `Notes` directory for detailed documentation.
