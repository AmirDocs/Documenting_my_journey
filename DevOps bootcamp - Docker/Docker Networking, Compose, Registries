# **DOCKER NETWORKING**

Docker networking ensures that the microservices architecture, which is different parts of an application running as independent services each in their own container, can communicate with each other efficiently and securely. Dockers networking model is highly scalable.

## **Basic Networking Concepts**: 
Docker provides several default network options you can use to manage how containers communicate.

- **Bridge Network**: Default network mode for containers on the same machine. Containers connected to the bridge network can communicate with each other using their own IP addresses and they are isolated from the host machine network. This provides an extra layer of security.

- **Host**: Uses the container's host machine network directly, without any isolation, with no distiction between the container and host. This mode is useful for applications that need to closely interact with the host system.

- **None**: This gives a container no network interface at all. This is used to ensure a container has no no network access whatsoever. This makes it completely isolated (A room with no doors or windows)
