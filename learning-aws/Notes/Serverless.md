# **SErVERLESS**
Serverless does not mean there are no servers, it means you just do not manage/ provision/ see them.

## **Severless in AWS**
**AWS Lambda** - is where it starts. You write your code in your function, upload it and AWS lambda runs it for you. Other important services in AWS are:

- **DynamoDB** - is a fully managed serverless no sequal database that scales automatically.
- **AWS Cognito** - is a service that enables you to add authentication, authorization, and user management to your web and mobile applications.
- **AWS API Gateway** - Acts as a bridge between users and Lambda functions, it allows you to create and monitor API's that interact with your backend services.
- **Amazon S3** - S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable secure object storage service for storing files.
- **AWS SNS & SQS** - Simple Notification Service handles notification and Simple Queue Service is for queing messages between services.
- **AWS Kinesis Data Firehose** - Load streaming data in AWS for analysis and storage.
- **Aurora Serverless** - Fully managed serverless database.
- **Step functions** - If you have workflows that involve many or multiple lambda functions, Step Functions helps you manage and monitor these workflows seamlessly.
- **Fargate** - Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
